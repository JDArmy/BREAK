    "title": "Spectator Wallhack",
    "definition": "A player uses a wallhack cheat on a secondary account to spectate their main account, typically found in FPS games.",
    "description": "The basic principle involves using two accounts: a main account and a secondary account used for spectating. After the main and secondary accounts become friends, the main account enters the game while the secondary account opens a wallhack to spectate the main account. Through the secondary account's wallhack, the main account can easily track enemy positions and gain an unfair advantage. If the secondary account is banned, the player creates a new one and continues.",
    "complexity": "Basic",
    "influence": "This behavior undermines game fairness and seriously impacts other players' experience.",
