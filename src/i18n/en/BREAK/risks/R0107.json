    "title": "Match Fixing",
    "definition": "Generally refers to malicious behavior in games where players collude to feed kills and absorb kills within the same match to manipulate the outcome, typically occurring in MOBA games and sometimes in FPS games.",
    "description": "Match fixers are primarily found in high-ranked competitive matches, engaging in organized and deliberate manipulation of match outcomes for specific purposes. The feeding and absorbing players have a financial relationship, which is the key distinction from ordinary passive gameplay. In recent years, as game security detection technology has improved, match fixing in MOBA games has become less blatant and increasingly covert. Beyond traditional kill-feeding behavior, there are now fixers who specifically target top streamers or professional players, manipulate match outcomes, and profit from sports betting.",
