    "title": "Escort Cheating",
    "definition": "A cheating method in games where multiple accounts are used to match into the same game as the 'boss' main account to escort them, helping the boss achieve better results and win rates.",
    "description": "Primarily found in shooting/competitive games. The escort players are split into two teams: one team is the paying 'boss' player (whose main goal is to rank up), and the other team uses a high-ranked main account (the 'driver') paired with a cheating secondary account (the 'enforcer'). Both teams queue at the same time to increase the chance of matching into the same game. Once the driver successfully gets the enforcer into a high-ranked match, the driver leaves the game. The enforcer then eliminates other players, and the boss waits until the final circle to defeat the enforcer and claim victory.",
