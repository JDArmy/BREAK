    "title": "Web Scraping Risk",
    "definition": "Scraping data provided by an application (product details, prices, inventory, reviews, etc.) for subsequent use. Scraping may occur in real time or more periodically.",
    "description": "Collecting accessible data and/or processed output from an application. Some scraping may use fake or stolen accounts, or access information without authentication. Scraping tools collect responses from static web pages/API interfaces and extract data from them, or decompile apps to parse static resources.",
    "complexity": "Intermediate",
    "influence": "Scraped business data may not cause actual losses to a company until it reaches a certain scale, but once scraped data reaches sufficient scale, it can be used for commercial competition or to analyze company operations in detail, causing significant business harm — for example, analyzing GMV or specific user groups.",
