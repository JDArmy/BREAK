    "definition": "The risk of using the anonymity and decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies to conduct money laundering through coin mixing, cross-chain transfers, and other means.",
    "description": "Cryptocurrency money laundering risk refers to criminals using Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies to launder funds. Main methods include: (1) Coin mixing services: using mixers like Tornado Cash to obscure fund flows and break transaction traceability. (2) Cross-chain bridge transfers: using cross-chain bridges to move funds between different blockchains to increase tracking difficulty. (3) Decentralized exchanges (DEX): using DEXs for KYC-free token swaps to evade anti-money laundering scrutiny from centralized exchanges. (4) Privacy coins: using Monero, Zcash, and other privacy coins to further conceal transaction information. (5) NFT money laundering: using fake NFT transactions to transfer funds. (6) OTC trading: converting cryptocurrency to fiat currency through over-the-counter trading. This risk poses serious threats to financial platforms, payment platforms, and e-commerce platforms, especially in scenarios involving virtual goods transactions.",
