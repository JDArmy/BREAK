    "complexity": "Basic",
    "influence": "Similar to black market metric manipulation (R0016) but different in nature. Metric manipulation has generally become an illegal commercial activity where operators inflate ratings for profit. Malicious reviews, however, are motivated by the intent to damage other users' or merchants' reputation and credibility — typically driven by pure malice or competitive business motives.",
