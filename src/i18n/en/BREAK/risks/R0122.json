(2) Rug pull: project teams disappearing with funds after NFT sales, leaving buyers with worthless investments. (3) Intellectual property infringement: minting others' artwork, brand logos, and other content as NFTs for sale without authorization. (4) Fake projects: creating fake NFT projects to attract investors through false promotion and community hype. (5) Phishing attacks: stealing users' crypto assets through fake NFT trading platforms or wallet connection requests. (6) Metadata tampering: modifying the associated digital asset content after NFT minting.",
