    "description": "A common method is to obtain user cookies to enable automated password-free login. Many account vendors sell accounts by providing only login cookies rather than credentials — known as CK trading. CK trading can bypass SMS verification code login and prevents buyers from changing passwords, enabling multiple resales of the same account.",

    "influence": "Many account systems do not invalidate existing login sessions after a password change, meaning that with stolen or reused cookies, a hacker can maintain persistent login access to the target user's account.",
