    "definition": "Registering domains similar to target brands, building impersonation websites, or creating fake social media accounts to conduct phishing attacks, traffic hijacking, or brand reputation damage.",
    "description": "Domain/brand impersonation refers to attackers using domains, page designs, or brand identities similar to well-known brands for fraudulent activities. Main forms include: (1) Typosquatting: registering domains with spellings close to the target brand (e.g., substituting letters, adding or removing characters) to phish users who mistype. (2) Homograph attacks: using visually similar Unicode characters to register domains that are difficult to distinguish with the naked eye. (3) Fake website construction: copying the target brand's website design to build high-fidelity phishing sites to steal user credentials and payment information. (4) Fake app publishing: publishing malicious apps impersonating the brand on unofficial app stores. (5) Social media impersonation: creating fake brand social media accounts for false marketing or fraud. (6) Search engine poisoning: using SEO techniques to rank impersonation websites highly in search results. (7) Subdomain takeover: exploiting expired but still DNS-recorded subdomains of the target brand for impersonation.",
