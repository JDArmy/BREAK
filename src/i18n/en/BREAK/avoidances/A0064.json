    "definition": "The ability to identify and determine whether content — including text, images, audio, video, and other media formats — has been generated by artificial intelligence.",
    "description": "The main technical approaches for AI content detection include: (1) statistical feature analysis — analyzing statistical features such as perplexity and burstiness to determine whether content is AI-generated; AI-generated text typically exhibits lower perplexity and more uniform word frequency distribution; (2) digital watermark detection — detecting implicit watermark markers embedded in AI-generated content, such as invisible watermarks planted by vendors like OpenAI; (3) deep learning classifiers — training specialized neural network models to distinguish human-created from AI-generated content by learning differences in semantics, style, and structure; (4) metadata analysis — examining EXIF information, generation tool signatures, and other metadata in image and video files to determine their origin; (5) adversarial detection — using adversarial sample techniques to detect AI-generated content that has been obfuscated; (6) multimodal fusion detection — combining text, image, audio, and other modalities for comprehensive judgment to improve detection accuracy.",
    "limitation": "The main limitations of AI content detection include: (1) arms race effect — as generative models continuously evolve, detection techniques need constant updates and face inherent lag; (2) misclassification risk — detection models may falsely flag human-created content as AI-generated, or fail to detect AI-generated content, especially content that has been manually polished; (3) cross-language differences — most detection tools are trained on English and may perform poorly on Chinese and other languages; (4) mixed content challenge — when humans and AI collaborate on creation, it is difficult to accurately determine the degree of AI involvement; (5) computational cost — large-scale real-time detection requires significant computational resources.",
