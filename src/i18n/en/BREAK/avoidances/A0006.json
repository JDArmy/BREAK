    "description": "User-generated content (UGC) includes but is not limited to: text, images, video (streams), links, etc. Malicious content varies by interest and scenario and includes but is not limited to: illegal content, violations, fraud, malicious promotion, etc. Simple text detection can be achieved by setting keywords; complex text content may also involve natural language processing. For image or video content, in addition to OCR text recognition, image content recognition is also required. For links, beyond blacklists and whitelists, some scenarios also require combining domain and link threat intelligence (A016-002) for more precise identification.",
    "limitation": "Malicious content detection is mostly based on keyword matching or scoring mechanisms from some type of strategy model, which allows attackers to counter detection through keyword bypasses, model bypasses, or borderline scoring techniques.",

    "limitation": "Due to the diversity and ambiguity of language, and the widespread existence of homophones, near-homophones, and visually similar characters in Chinese, it is very easy to bypass automated malicious text detection and produce malicious text that preserves the original meaning.

Therefore, in some necessary or extreme scenarios, manual content review (A006-007) needs to be introduced as a supplement.",
