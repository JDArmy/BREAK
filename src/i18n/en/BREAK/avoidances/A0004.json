    "definition": "Controlling the access frequency when a visitor requests related resources.",
    "description": "Rate limiting can be used in scenarios such as traffic peak shaving. Its purpose is to relieve server pressure. For crawler scenarios with extremely high-frequency data requests far exceeding normal human request rates, it has a relatively direct blocking effect, preventing traffic far exceeding server capacity from causing denial of service and cascading failures.",
    "limitation": "Unlike crawler identification (A003), rate limiting does not strictly distinguish between human traffic and automated traffic. This means that a threshold set too low will mistakenly block some legitimate human requests, while a threshold set too high will let through low-frequency crawlers. Therefore, it cannot be considered an effective crawler identification and blocking measure.",
