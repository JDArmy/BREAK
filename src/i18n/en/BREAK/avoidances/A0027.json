    "definition": "Using customer service phone follow-ups and similar methods to confirm user authenticity or the legitimacy of their actions.",
    "description": "In certain specialized business scenarios (such as financial scenarios), when the system identifies abnormal user behavior during the handling process, customer service phone follow-ups can be combined to notify users or verify user legitimacy.",
    "limitation": "Because customer service follow-up confirmation has a relatively high cost, it is generally only used for confirming major business risks rather than all business risks. Additionally, the effectiveness of customer service follow-up confirmation is heavily dependent on the professionalism and attitude of the customer service staff.",
