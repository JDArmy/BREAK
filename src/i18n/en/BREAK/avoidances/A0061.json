    "description": "Some typical ways to reduce returns include: reducing bonus amounts under sustained referral farming; in games, reducing item drop rates or monster kill scores under sustained gold farming; and similar approaches.",
    "limitation": "Reducing returns is a preferred method for lowering attractiveness, but as long as there is still value, it is difficult to fully control. It can have a significant negative impact on the experience of highly motivated high-value users, thereby affecting their engagement.",
