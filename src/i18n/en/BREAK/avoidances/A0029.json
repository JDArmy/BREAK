In plain terms, it means assigning tags to users — tags are highly refined characteristic identifiers derived from analyzing user information. Through labeling, users can be described using highly summarized, easy-to-understand characteristics, making it easier for people to understand users and for computers to process them.",

    "description": "IP profiling can include multiple aspects such as the IP address's geographic location, carrier, network quality, and user profile, and can be used to determine whether the IP address poses a risk or is a malicious IP. In the network security field, IP profiling is an important technical means that can help enterprises better understand threats and anomalous behavior in the network, improving network security protection capabilities. Through IP profiling, enterprises can quickly locate and handle malicious attacks, fraud, and other network security incidents, protecting business and data security.",
