    "definition": "Real-time monitoring and analysis of user behavior in systems, networks, or applications to identify activities that differ significantly from normal behavior patterns, thereby detecting potential anomalies, fraud, or security threats.",
    "description": "Key aspects of anomalous behavior detection include: modeling normal behavior — the system first learns and models the normal behavior patterns of users or entities by analyzing historical data, user behavior patterns, device characteristics, etc.; monitoring real-time behavior — after establishing a normal behavior model, the system continuously monitors real-time behavior, including user logins, access patterns, interaction behavior, and data access; detecting anomalous behavior — the system uses pre-established models and rules to detect behavior that significantly deviates from normal patterns, potentially involving statistical analysis, machine learning, rule engines, and other techniques; real-time response — upon detecting anomalous behavior, the system should immediately take appropriate measures such as issuing alerts, interrupting access, or forcing re-authentication; iterative optimization — anomalous behavior detection systems need continuous iteration and optimization to adapt to evolving threats and environments, including updating models, adjusting rules, and adopting new algorithms. In information security, anomalous behavior detection can identify intrusions, malware, and unauthorized access. In finance, it can detect credit card fraud and money laundering. In healthcare, it can monitor patient physiological data to identify potential health issues.",
    "limitation": "Anomalous behavior detection has several practical limitations, including false positive and false negative rates — the system may incorrectly flag normal behavior as anomalous or miss genuinely anomalous behavior. Adversarial attacks may make the system easier to evade, while concept drift, privacy concerns, resource consumption, and imbalanced data distribution are also challenges. When designing and applying anomalous behavior detection systems, these limitations must be considered comprehensively and appropriate measures taken to improve robustness and performance.",
