    "description": "Credit grading applies different restrictions to users based on their credit level. For example, users with a high credit rating may enjoy more privileges, while users with a low credit rating enjoy fewer. The goal is to deter malicious behavior and incentivize users to improve their credit standing. Methods include behavior-based, attribute-based, relationship-based, and evaluation-based credit grading.",
    "limitation": "Credit analysis relies on the platform's collection and analysis of user behavior, attributes, relationships, and evaluations, so it cannot identify new high-quality users and may to some extent reduce the motivation of new high-quality users.",
