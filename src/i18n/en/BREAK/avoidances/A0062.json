    "title": "Video Surveillance",
    "definition": "A technology that uses cameras, monitors, computer software and hardware, and other technical means to perform real-time monitoring and remote control of specific areas.",
    "description": "Traditional surveillance systems include front-end cameras, transmission cables, and video surveillance platforms. Cameras can be divided into network digital cameras and analog cameras, serving as front-end video image signal collectors. Video surveillance is widely used in many settings due to its intuitive, accurate, timely, and information-rich nature. Modern surveillance systems can use smartphones, with automatic image recognition, storage, and automatic alerting. Video data is transmitted back to a control host via 3G/4G/WiFi, where it can be viewed in real time, recorded, played back, retrieved, and stored, enabling mobile internet-based video surveillance.",
    "limitation": "Video surveillance relies heavily on personnel to interpret footage and has a certain degree of latency.",
