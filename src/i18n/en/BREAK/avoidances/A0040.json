    "description": "Also known as SSL Pinning. Certificate pinning is a protective measure that pins the server's SSL certificate in the client, preventing attackers from intercepting and modifying network traffic via a man-in-the-middle attack.",
    "limitation": "Certificate pinning is a relatively basic security defense mechanism aimed at raising the bar for man-in-the-middle attacks. However, sophisticated attackers can use various techniques to replace the pinned SSL certificate in the client with a custom certificate to bypass this defense.",
