    "title": "Adding Approval Processes",
    "definition": "Introducing additional approval steps in an organization or project to ensure the legality, compliance, and traceability of decisions.",
    "description": "Key practices include: approver assignment — designating approvers for each step based on their responsibilities and authority; approval conditions and rules — defining the conditions and rules that trigger approval, such as expenditures exceeding a certain amount or critical decisions; electronic approval systems — using electronic approval tools to automate and streamline the approval process, improving efficiency and reducing human error; approval logs and records — recording decisions at each approval step to support auditing and traceability.",
    "limitation": "Limitations include: efficiency issues — too many approval steps may slow down decision-making and reduce work efficiency; human error — manual approval processes are prone to mistakes or oversights; process complexity — overly complex approval processes may be difficult to understand and manage, increasing maintenance burden; applicability constraints — not all scenarios require additional approval steps, and some simple decisions may become unnecessarily cumbersome.",
