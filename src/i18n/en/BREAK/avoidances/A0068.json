    "title": "Zero Trust Architecture",
    "definition": "A security model whose core principle is 'never trust, always verify.' Rather than implicitly trusting any user, device, or service based on network location, every access request is subject to continuous identity verification and authorization.",
    "description": "The main implementation elements of Zero Trust Architecture include: (1) continuous identity verification — continuously verifying the identity of users and devices rather than only at login, dynamically adjusting verification strength based on risk level; (2) least privilege principle — strictly limiting the access permissions of users and services, granting only the minimum set of permissions needed to complete the current task; (3) micro-segmentation — dividing the network into fine-grained security zones to restrict lateral movement, so that even if an attacker breaches one zone they cannot easily spread; (4) device trust assessment — continuously evaluating the security posture of connected devices, including operating system version, patch status, and security software status; (5) encrypted communications — all communications use encrypted transmission, whether on internal or external networks; (6) security analytics and automation — using SIEM, SOAR, and other tools for real-time security analysis and automated response; (7) software-defined perimeter (SDP) — using SDP technology to hide network resources, making them visible only to authenticated and authorized users.",
    "limitation": "The limitations of Zero Trust Architecture include: (1) high implementation complexity requiring large-scale transformation of existing IT infrastructure with significant cost; (2) potential impact on user experience as frequent identity verification and permission checks may reduce work efficiency; (3) poor compatibility with legacy systems that may not support the authentication and authorization mechanisms required by Zero Trust; (4) requires robust identity management infrastructure; (5) full implementation of Zero Trust is a long-term process that is difficult to cover all business scenarios in the short term.",
