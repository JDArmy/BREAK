    "definition": "The Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) is a methodology for embedding security practices throughout the entire software development process, reducing security vulnerabilities at the source through requirements analysis, design review, secure coding, security testing, and other phases.",
    "description": "The Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) is a systematic approach that integrates security into the entire software development process. Main phases and practices include: (1) security requirements analysis — identifying security requirements and compliance needs in the requirements phase, conducting threat modeling, and defining security baselines; (2) security design review — conducting security reviews of system architecture and detailed design to identify design-level security flaws and ensure adherence to security principles such as least privilege and defense in depth; (3) secure coding standards — developing and promoting secure coding standards covering key areas such as input validation, output encoding, authentication and authorization, cryptographic handling, and error handling; (4) static application security testing (SAST) — automatically scanning source code for security vulnerabilities using static code analysis tools during the coding phase; (5) dynamic application security testing (DAST) — performing black-box security testing on running applications during the testing phase to discover runtime security vulnerabilities; (6) open-source component security management (SCA) — scanning project dependencies for security vulnerabilities and license compliance issues; (7) pre-launch security review — conducting security reviews and penetration testing before application launch to ensure security release standards are met; (8) security operations feedback — feeding online security incidents back into the development process to continuously improve security practices.",
    "limitation": "The limitations of SDL include: (1) full SDL implementation increases development time and cost, and is difficult to implement in fast-iterating agile development; (2) false positives from security tools may affect development efficiency, causing developers to ignore security alerts; (3) security talent shortage makes it difficult to assign professional security personnel to every development team; (4) SDL cannot completely eliminate security vulnerabilities and still requires runtime protection and incident response capabilities; (5) security risks from third-party components and APIs are difficult to fully control through internal SDL processes.",
