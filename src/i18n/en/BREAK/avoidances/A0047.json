    "title": "Security Deposit Mechanism",
    "definition": "Also known as a deposit or earnest money, this requires users to pay a certain amount as collateral when using platform services, which may be forfeited upon breach of contract.",
    "description": "A deposit (also called a security deposit or risk margin in practice) is an amount agreed upon by both parties, paid by the debtor or a third party to the creditor as a guarantee of performance. When the obligation is fulfilled, the deposit is returned or offset; when the obligation is not fulfilled, the creditor has priority claim to the funds. The party paying the deposit is called the depositor, generally the debtor or a third party. The party receiving the deposit is called the depositee, who is the creditor.",
    "limitation": "If the deposit amount is too large it will dampen user motivation; if too small it will reduce the deterrent effect. A careful trade-off is required.",
