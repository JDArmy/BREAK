    "definition": "Conducting continuous security audits of user accounts to detect account risks in a timely manner.",
    "description": "Similar to the risk monitoring mechanism of risk control strategies (A015), identity behavior monitoring and risk assessment is also an audit-based protective measure. However, the two differ in their protection subjects and objects: risk control protects the business from users, while identity behavior auditing protects users from attackers. Identity security auditing is a commonly used means of assessing identity security. After an anomaly is detected, it needs to be combined with other identity measures such as re-authentication (A018), multi-factor authentication (A007), and forced password reset (A012).",
    "limitation": "Generally, identity security auditing relies on detecting abnormal account behavior, which requires a certain amount of time and data as a reference baseline. Additionally, in some cases, identity security auditing has a certain degree of latency — subsequent handling or loss mitigation is required after a risk is identified.",
