    "definition": "Taking legal measures to combat attackers.",
    "description": "Legal action is both an effective means of stopping ongoing harm and a deterrent through publicizing the results of enforcement. Currently, criminal statutes related to cybercrime include: Article 285 'Unauthorized Access to Computer Information Systems,' Article 286 'Destruction of Computer Information Systems,' Article 287 'Assisting in Information Network Crimes,' Article 253 'Infringement of Citizens' Personal Information,' Article 219 'Infringement of Trade Secrets,' etc. Additionally, Article 255 'Illegal Business Operations' and Article 217 'Copyright Infringement,' while not cybercrime-specific statutes, are frequently used in cybercrime convictions.",
    "limitation": "The prerequisites for legal action are: 1. There must be illegal or criminal facts that can be referenced against legal statutes; 2. The attacker must be locatable and apprehensible; 3. Criminal evidence and the amount of criminal proceeds must be fixable. For example, web scraping is a common violation that enterprises deeply resent, but there is no specific criminal basis for scraping in the statutes. Scraping only meets the conditions for legal action when it involves: breaking into a system (285), causing a system to malfunction (286), obtaining a certain amount of users' personal information (253), providing paid scraping services to others (255), etc., and when the criminal amount can be very accurately determined, non-criminal amounts distinguished, and the suspect can be located and apprehended within the jurisdiction.",
