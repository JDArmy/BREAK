    "title": "Algorithm Audit Mechanism",
    "definition": "A systematic inspection and evaluation of algorithmic systems to ensure their fairness, transparency, explainability, and compliance, preventing algorithmic discrimination, bias, and misuse.",
    "description": "The main components of an algorithm audit mechanism include: (1) fairness assessment — detecting decision-making disparities across different groups (such as gender, age, and region) to identify potential discrimination and bias issues; (2) transparency review — evaluating the transparency of algorithmic decision-making processes to ensure users can understand the algorithmic logic affecting their rights; (3) explainability analysis — using explainable AI techniques such as SHAP and LIME to analyze the key factors and reasoning paths behind algorithmic decisions; (4) data auditing — reviewing the quality, representativeness, and bias of training data to ensure data sources are legal and compliant; (5) impact assessment — evaluating the potential impact of algorithms on user rights, market competition, and social equity; (6) compliance checking — checking the compliance of algorithmic systems against regulatory requirements such as the Provisions on the Administration of Algorithmic Recommendations for Internet Information Services; (7) periodic review — establishing a regular algorithm audit system to track changes in algorithm performance and fairness metrics; (8) third-party auditing — engaging independent third-party organizations to conduct algorithm audits to improve objectivity and credibility.",
    "limitation": "The limitations of algorithm audit mechanisms include: (1) complex deep learning models have inherent black-box characteristics, making it technically difficult to fully understand their decision logic; (2) the definition of fairness may vary across different scenarios and cultural contexts, making it difficult to establish uniform standards; (3) algorithm auditing requires specialized technical capabilities and domain knowledge, and qualified auditors and organizations are relatively scarce; (4) audit results may be influenced by the choice of audit methods and evaluation metrics; (5) dynamically updated algorithm models require continuous auditing, and one-time audits cannot guarantee long-term compliance.",
