    "title": "Internal Review Mechanism",
    "definition": "A set of review procedures and measures established by a company to monitor and evaluate employee behavior and ensure compliance with company policies and regulations.",
    "description": "Scenarios may include but are not limited to: behavioral compliance review — examining whether employee behavior meets the company's ethical and regulatory requirements, including the absence of fraud, corruption, bribery, and other misconduct; data access review — monitoring employee access to sensitive data and company resources to ensure access is limited to work responsibilities; network activity review — monitoring employee activity on the company network to prevent cybersecurity risks and improper use of company resources; internal investigations — when violations or reports occur, conducting internal investigations to verify the relevant circumstances.",
    "limitation": "The limitation of internal review mechanisms is the need to balance oversight with employee privacy. Excessive review may infringe on personal privacy rights, cause employee dissatisfaction, and reduce job satisfaction. Review procedures must strictly comply with regulations to prevent compliance risks. Additionally, review mechanisms may be subject to internal bias or errors, leading to inaccurate results.",
