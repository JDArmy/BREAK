    "definition": "Tracking the access source of resources to determine the reliability and reasonableness of the source.",
    "description": "Common source tracking checks the Referer header in resource requests. However, there are now more sophisticated approaches: one is to generate encrypted access tokens with time-based, random, and unique properties in the pre-access page for in-site resource access to track resource access; the other is to embed the sharer's identity information as an access token in the shared link when resources are shared off-site. This way, both in-site and off-site resource access can be tracked, enabling identification and blocking of abnormal sources.",
    "limitation": "Two foreseeable breakable scenarios are: 1. For in-site access, attackers can obtain in-site resource access tokens by bulk-constructing resource pre-access pages. 2. For off-site access, in high-traffic scenarios such as advertising and promotion, it is difficult to determine whether token acquisition is non-compliant based on volume alone. For scenario 1, the pre-access page can be included in the tracking coverage, or the randomness of resources in the pre-access page can be increased to prevent targeted resource access. For scenario 2, the off-site resource access ID can be encoded to decouple it from targeted in-site resource access.",
