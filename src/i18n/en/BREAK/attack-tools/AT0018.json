    "description": "Root refers to obtaining superuser administrator privileges on Android phones. After gaining root access, the Android superuser account can be used to flash custom ROMs, modify files, or enable originally disabled features. The account has permissions to access and modify almost all files on the phone. Jailbreaking is the equivalent of Root on Apple's iOS system.",
