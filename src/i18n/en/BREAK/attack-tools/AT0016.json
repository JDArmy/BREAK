    "description": "A cloud phone applies cloud computing technology to network terminal services, implementing phone functionality through cloud servers. It is essentially a smartphone deeply integrated with network services. Based on end-cloud integrated virtualization technology, cloud phones elastically adapt to user needs through cloud networking, security, and AI capabilities, offloading hardware resources and loading massive cloud applications on demand. Users can remotely control cloud phones in real time via video streaming, enabling Android native apps and mobile games to run in the cloud.",
