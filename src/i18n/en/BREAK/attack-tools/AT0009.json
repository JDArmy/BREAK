    "description": "A mass control system uses automated control integration technology to map multiple phone interfaces directly to a computer monitor, enabling one computer to control dozens or even hundreds of phones simultaneously. The system numbers each phone's interface on the control computer, corresponding to the same-numbered phone, achieving one-to-one phone operation control. Mass control systems typically consist of software and hardware components.",
