    "description": "Packet capture tools are software that intercepts and inspects the contents of network data packets. Because they can capture all IP packets during data communication and perform layer-by-layer unpacking analysis, they have long been commonly used troubleshooting tools in traditional fixed-network maintenance. Popular packet capture software includes Wireshark, SnifferPro, Snoop, and Tcpdump.",
