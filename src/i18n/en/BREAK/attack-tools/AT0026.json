    "description": "Score-running platforms are online platforms that illegally provide payment settlement services for illegal activities (such as gambling, pornography, and fraud) through third-party payment platforms, partner banks, and other service provider interfaces. When gamblers top up funds on overseas gambling websites, this information is published on score-running platforms, and registered members grab orders in a manner similar to ride-hailing. After successfully grabbing an order, the gambling platform displays a corresponding payment QR code, and the gambler transfers funds directly to the platform member via the QR code.",
