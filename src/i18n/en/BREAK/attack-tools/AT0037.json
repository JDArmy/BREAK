    "description": "These tools perform comprehensive backups of a phone's current state, data, and device fingerprints, and restore them when needed. They can back up all files generated by a target app during runtime, then restore those files on a new device to deceive the app's server into thinking the account has always been operated on the same device, gradually increasing account permissions for account nurturing and user retention purposes.",
