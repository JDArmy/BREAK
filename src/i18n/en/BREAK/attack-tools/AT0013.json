    "description": "A computer trojan virus is a piece of malicious code with special functions hidden in a normal program. It is a backdoor program capable of destroying and deleting files, sending passwords, recording keystrokes, and attacking systems. Trojan programs appear harmless on the surface and may even be attractive to unsuspecting users, often hidden in games or graphics software. A complete trojan program generally consists of two parts: a server-side component and a controller-side component.",
