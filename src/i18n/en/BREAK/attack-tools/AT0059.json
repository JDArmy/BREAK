    "description": "AI voice cloning tools use deep learning technology to generate synthetic voices highly similar to a target person based on a small amount of voice samples (typically only a few seconds to a few minutes). These tools use Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Voice Conversion technology to generate cloned voices of any content in real time or offline. Representative technologies include VALL-E, Bark, and Tortoise-TTS. Attackers use voice cloning tools for phone fraud (impersonating friends or leaders), bypassing voiceprint authentication systems, and creating fake audio evidence.",
