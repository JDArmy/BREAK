    "description": "Ranking manipulation tools simulate manual operations to inflate network clicks, views, comments, and other metrics. These tools generally fall into two categories: human-powered and machine-powered. Human-powered means real users download specified apps — this method has the lowest risk and best results but higher cost. Machine-powered tools either simulate user search, download, and install data from different regions without needing real phones, or establish studios with large numbers of phones running automated scripts and one-click device spoofing programs.",
