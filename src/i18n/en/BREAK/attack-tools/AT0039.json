    "description": "The 4-piece identity document set refers to an ID card, the corresponding phone SIM card, the corresponding bank card, and an online banking USB key. This complete identity impersonation package is known as the '4-piece set' in black markets. Generally, the bank cards already have online banking activated, and some SIM cards even have prepaid credit. More sophisticated 4-piece set dealers can even customize specific hometown, gender, age, mobile carrier, and bank for buyers.",
