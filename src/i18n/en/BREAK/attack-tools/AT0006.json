    "description": "SMS verification codes are used in internet businesses to filter low-value users. The gray/black market has developed SMS verification code platforms in response to phone number-based registration. These platforms stockpile large numbers of SIM cards to provide SMS sending and receiving services. Large platforms have been found to hold millions of SIM cards, while smaller ones hold tens of thousands. These platforms use virtual phone numbers to receive SMS verification codes, operating as a gray industry that undermines internet real-name registration requirements.",
